## Overview

The Creeping Mass is one of the only known immense level star spawn. A creature of massive size spanning miles in width centred upon the destroyed city of [[All/Ceres\|Ceres]]. It isn't known how this creature came to be only that it originated from [[All/Ceres\|Ceres]] and proceeded to take over the city and the surrounding land. 

The Creeping Mass is a forest of flesh and bone that grows and changes every second of every day. Bursting from the city of [[All/Ceres\|Ceres]] it consumes all life it encounters adding it to the mass of jabbering mouths and eyes. It may have been a creature once but now has mutated so far beyond the normal limits that it has become a collection of illogical and irrational limbs interconnected with sinew and bone. This mass is seemingly infinite as the more you cut away the stronger it becomes, regenerating any lost mass indefinitely. 

The city of [[All/Ceres\|Ceres]] now more resembles that of a labyrinth of bone and flesh like that of the internals of a living being however with a form so asinine its impossible to comprehend.

## Witness Statement
><span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)"><span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">"It burst from the ground and within a matter of seconds covered the Smithy district</span>" </span>
><span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">"The tendrils grabbed all those around it and either consumed them or killed them first before consuming them. All I could do was watch as its pale black purple flesh spilled from the cracks in the ground and from the gutters"</span>
><span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">"Then came the eyes, I could feel there stare piercing my mind trying to subdue me but my blind panic forced my legs to move of their own accord. So I ran dodging tendrils, mouths and boney spines left right and centre." </span>
><span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">"I ran from the city as I watched spells bursting trying to stop this tide of organism but to no avail as people, hundreds of people were pulled in never to be seen again"</span>
>A recount from the few that survived now traumatised for the rest of their lives.

## Misc

There have been multiple attempts from many different people to try and rid [[All/Ceres\|Ceres]] of this plague but the most notable of these attempts was that of [[All/The Martyrs\|The Martyrs]] who for a brief period of time manage to clear most of the Carvers district. This however quickly fell when they ran out of resources and had to retreat.

# Rumours

#### Old Artefacts

Although this city has been taken over before this creature this city was renown for its artisanal talents and crafted a great number of artefacts. If greatly lucky or incredibly talented group of fighters could possibly retrieve these lost artefacts for themselves or for their city.

#### The Heart

Due to being a living creature it is presumed that this [[All/Star Spawn\|Star Spawn]] has a form of weakness and this could potentially be a heart of some kind. If it were possible to destroy this heart or whatever resembles this vital organ perhaps the evil could be destroyed forever. However this would take an effort far greater than any one group could achieve.
