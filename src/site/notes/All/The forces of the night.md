# The forces of the night

![alteration-min.png](/img/user/All/alteration-min.png)
***

Across the plane of [[All/Palladius\|Palladius]] there are many different creatures that have spawned since [[All/The Day Of Oblivion\|The Day Of Oblivion]] most of which will be familiar to you the reader however with a twist. The origins of these creatures are not known only that they came from the ground not long after the protecting light of [[All/Estelle\|Estelle]] vanished upon her death. Research is often done into the morphology of these creatures and why they all appeared at the same time and how an alarmingly large number of these creatures bear a strange magical resemblance to one another. 

Across all of these creatures there is a variety that range in how common they are and then how likely they are to be encountered upon exiting the safe walls of a [[All/Cities of Palladius\|city]]. This commonality has some benefits generally the more common the creature the weaker the creatures generally tend to be. This poses the question to many different Archanists across the plane that there seems to be a connection between how common a creature is and how dangerous it appears to be. 

These categories are not exhaustive but generally are an idea of the tier of monster one could expect to find.

## Common creatures 

#### Zombies

Zombies like many other creatures of this plane possess a unnatural resistance to [[All/Stellite\|Stellite]] being almost immune to the effects. It is proposed to be that the creation of these creatures perhaps involved [[All/Stellite\|Stellite]] in some way shape or form.

Zombies in particular are generally a form of reanimated corpse however they do not carry a form of infectious disease so the likelihood that one becomes a zombie from an encounter with one of these creatures is slim.

They are generally slow, weak and come in packs however bear an unwillingness to lay to rest and refuse to go down. So it is always recommended to make sure one is down for the count before turning your back. 

#### Were creatures/lycan

![Werecreatures.jpg|right|300](/img/user/All/Werecreatures.jpg)Were creatures are one of these common creatures that you find across this plane. These creatures try to mimic or blend in with crowds or caravans to varying success or use hunting tactics to mimic and lure people away from their groups to pounce on them. Due to the lack of a full moon these creatures transform at will or when there is a strong scent of blood.

This means that once one person in a group dies the combat gets a whole lot more difficult. Once they transform their skin becomes thicker and more resistant to all forms of attack as they become more agile and stronger too. At this point it is recommended to flee from this creature as quick as possible.

## Uncommon creatures

#### Hags/ witches

![dorina-roka-hag2-export2.jpg|right|200](/img/user/All/dorina-roka-hag2-export2.jpg)Unlike the traditional sense of the word witch these creatures do not relate to mortal kind at all. They are tricksy monstrous creatures that prey on the weak offering boons or prizes in trade for their life. They can be powerful with magic and very hard to deal with so in the scenario that you encounter one of these creatures it is best to run and hide. 

It is recommended to stick close together and to ensure that there are proper protections for your group put in place before venturing outside of the cites as very quickly one of these creatures could kill you.

#### Chimera

![adam-burnier-chimera04.jpg|right|200](/img/user/All/adam-burnier-chimera04.jpg)
These creatures look to be the amalgamations of many other creatures combined fused into a beast of great power. Their forms are twisted and sophisticated but lack intelligence to fully use this power. 
Many of these creatures come with unnatural powers gained from the beast fused to create these monsters. 
A proper plan is recommended to fight one of these creatures as one slip up can instantly put an end to your life. 
Running is not recommended usually as most of the time these creatures will have some form of movement ability making it near impossible to escape them.

## Rare creatures

#### Lesser Star Spawn

![The Lost.webp|right|200](/img/user/All/The%20Lost.webp)
This Foul beast is the very late stages of a humanoid corrupted with [[All/Stellite\|Stellite]] and these creatures should be killed on sight ideally. If one of these creatures is able to stumble into any form of [[All/Stellite\|Stellite]] it may be enough to push their mutation to the next level. This would create a [[All/Star Spawn\|Star Spawn]] and any more of these creatures is a detriment to life. 
They are unpredictable they are fast and they can be much more of a trouble in the long run if not removed quickly.
However if you are under equipped for this fight it can easily get out of hand. These creatures mostly bear the resemblance of a real person and can easily trick the untrained eye into following them. 

#### Rot Troll

![Rot Troll.webp|right|300](/img/user/All/Rot%20Troll.webp)
This foul creature is a host for disease and infection and should be avoided at all costs as contact with the creature or being in its presence can infect the skin on your bones making you incredibly sick.
If one of these creatures must be combatted it is recommended that you do not touch, breathe or stay within the creatures presence for longer than a minute. It is recommended to use ranged spells and weapons keeping a healthy distance between you and it.

## Things of note

Keep in mind that the variety of these creatures is immense and there is no defined list of what you will find out in the wilds so it is best to keep an eye out and be aware. If forced to travel it is recommended that large groups are formed to protect all of those in the party. 

Furthermore even if an encounter is going smoothly with one of these creatures in the wild it is always best to finish the fight as quickly as possible. This is because the noise and commotion from one fight could attract the attention of others that may be much more difficult to handle.

Finally if you are to encounter a star spawn the best option is to run. Don't fight just run. You may thing you are strong enough or quick enough but you aren't, they are faster stronger and unpredictable. If you somehow escape an encounter with one of these creatures report immediately to [[All/The Martyrs\|The Martyrs]] and inform them of as much detail as you can remember and the whereabouts of this creature. From here [[All/The Martyrs\|The Martyrs]] can formulate a plan to lure away or even kill this creature.
