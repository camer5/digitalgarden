## An overview

Stellite appears to be a metal with otherworldly properties. Many of which are unfavourable to the living. However this material possesses a latent energy within the structure of the metal that makes the use of this material very beneficial. But due to many laws and legislations the usage or even possession of this [[All/Materials of Palladius\|metal]] has been forbidden and is punishable by death. The [[The Magistrates \|council]] came to this conclusion within the fist years after  [[All/The Day Of Oblivion\|The Day Of Oblivion]].

## Description

Not many people live to tell the tale when it comes to Stellite so our understanding and study of the material is very limited due to both its corrupting nature but also its presence in the eyes of [[All/The Magistrates\|The Magistrates]]. However a couple of accounts have been gathered.

> <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)"> "I remember walking down the corridor as that feeling in my stomach grew stronger almost as if something was grasping at it and twisting. </span> 
><span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">Then finally I came into a large cathedral hall as at the opposite end I could feel it. As soon as my eyes met the ebony surface of this material I could feel my mind racing as whispers rattled around my head causing an irresistible itch across my body stunning me.</span>
><span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">I could feel it piercing my consciousness as I noticed that in my stupor my body had been moving of its own accord. Standing a rooms width closer to the large chunk of material I could see horrors of which I daren't repeat.</span> 
><span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">The surface of the material was reflective almost like glass, a gloss that was so unnatural yet the surface behind it was endless. A void of which that seemingly never ended a black so true nothing could compare. Across its black form there were craters that only were visible as it caught the light permeating through the muddied windows.</span> 
><span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">It was at that point I could stand it no longer I ripped myself from the temptation forcefully. I gouged into my eye to flood my system with pain in the hopes to relinquish its hold on me. For a moment and only a moment I was free of the temptation and I ran.</span>
><span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">As I retreated my skin began to burn with a sensation of which I had never felt. It was as if the entirety of my skin was on fire with seemingly no damage. My movements became weak as I could feel the organs within my form shifting as a similar pain began to set within me as well. </span>
><span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">I fear if I were not a mutant kin myself there would have been no chance for me. However even with this lifeline I barely survived and if it weren't for my squad there would have been no hope for me." </span>

This was an excerpt from an interview with [[All/Carrion\|Carrion]] one of the [[All/ArchBishops\|ArchBishops]] of [[All/The Martyrs\|The Martyrs]]. 

As stated this material is stated to have a black form with a glass like gloss. Its surface is pitted with craters and generally it is found in shards that have a sharpness akin to broken obsidian.

## Origins

This metal is believed to have be formed when the goddess [[All/Estelle\|Estelle]] ruptured into a billion pieces. Upon rupturing their body and essence solidified into a metallic substance. However due to the presence of the [[All/Seed of evil\|Seed of evil]] bound to [[All/Estelle\|Estelle]]'s essence it created a twisted element formed of the combination of [[All/Estelle\|Estelle]]'s power and the corrupting and mutating energies presumed to be within this very [[All/Seed of evil\|seed]]. 

This is unfortunately just a  theory because of the restriction of the usage and possession of the material by [[All/The Magistrates\|The Magistrates]] meaning legal research is impossible. Although these rulings do not scare some people and they proceed anyways.

## Ramifications

When this material fell from the sky not only did it devastate [[All/Landscape\|regions]] by colliding with them, it also warded away creatures due to the psychic effects. Those not quick enough were mutated into hideous creatures far beyond recognition. This has created ecological dead zones commonly called [[All/Crypts\|Crypts]]. These zones are not barren of terrain features or even cities they are just devoid of natural life. These [[All/Crypts\|Crypts]] can be formed for a number of reasons one of them being the presence of [[All/The Umbra\|The Umbra]], a silvery black mist that shares similar properties to Stellite but in a much larger area and to a weaker effect. Another reason for these [[All/Crypts\|Crypts]] can be the presence of large shards of Stellite causing effects similar to radiation. 

Stellite on a micro scale when coming in contact with or in the presence of organic life will generally mutate and corrupt the being it is near. A small amount of this corruption is not deadly but can quickly get out of hand if not properly tended too.
This corruption progresses in 5 stages.

# Stage 1
![Stage one of Stellite poisoning-min.png](/img/user/All/Stage%20one%20of%20Stellite%20poisoning-min.png)
  >[!Transcript] 
 >The first stage of Stellite poisoning is that of burns across the skin, unlike burns 
caused by fire natural ointments created from mushrooms dont generally work. 
This stage however is the least dangerour of the lot. 
These burns are generally cuase red anb black marks across the skin as small sections
of the body become partially corrupted. This comes with other minor sideffects like: 
nausea, vomiting, itching, mild headaches and minor psychic damage 
(manifesting as whispering or early stages of insanity).
However these symptoms can be reversed if proper and quick care is taken. 
A dosage of:Clear water infused with 3oz of limolean extract, 15g of pulverised 
palladium, 3 charred lions mane mushrooms and 20oz of quick silver. To be taken once before rest and twice after

# Stage 2
![Stage two of Stellite poisoning-min(2).png](/img/user/All/Stage%20two%20of%20Stellite%20poisoning-min(2).png)
>[!Transcript]
>Within stage two of this corruption the body begins to warp and change as multiple
organs within the body begin to succumb to the corruption. This material causes harsh 
changes to the body with most being reversable over long periods of time although 
costly. But in spite of this there are some benefits to this creeping corruption.
Other than the quality of living reductions an increase in magical potential has 
been noted in all patients suffering from this condition, this also covers mental 
cognition and also some other potentially psychic abilities. Many seek out this level
of power but ever so slightly over the line and the symptoms begin a harsh runaway
effect where the user craves more of this material or exposure to it.
The symptoms of this are generally the same but to a much more severe degree this 
however is the  last stage in which this is true

# Stage 3

![Stage three of Stellite poisoning-min.png](/img/user/All/Stage%20three%20of%20Stellite%20poisoning-min.png)
>[!Transcript]
>This is the point of which there is no return. If a member of your family or a friend or child reaches this point in the corruption it is best to put an end to their suffering as from here on out the likelihood of a cure becomes 0%. 
However in future as technology becomes more advanced there may be a way to remove this corruption but as of current no such methods exist. I have conducted a many a number of tests and none of these experiments bore fruit.
Symptoms:
Upon the body sections of their form will become black and leathery or show signs of this nature under the skin. Spikes of stellite or other organic matter (e.g. bone, cartilage, hardened skin or even a nail like material)rupture the skin leaving lacerations at their  breach point. Around this area the skin begins to peel and shed as it decays and perishes, this manifests as redness and open wounds. 
Generally at this point the digits or extremities of the person will blacken and in most cases form sharp boney talons. With these talons the subject will claw at the skin creating further wounds. Finally the subject will become  unresponsive to conversation as the madness fully manifests as they become inconsolable and  violent. I would advise permanent restrainment/imprisonment and a mercy execution. This  prevents anyone else being injured by this creature.
If not properly contained as soon as a creature reaches this stage then they will progress to tier 4 of their corruption  and this must be avoided at all costs!

# Stage 4

![Stage four of Stellite poisoning-min.png](/img/user/All/Stage%20four%20of%20Stellite%20poisoning-min.png)
>[!Transcript]
If somehow a creature manages to make it to this stage within the corruption process you must kill them on sight. when a creature makes it to this stage it will rampage through anywhere it senses life even if it is the undeath or other corrupted. These beings are fuelled by an intense rage and an insatiable hunger for stellite and if one of these creatures manages to find a portion with enough power then a whole city will be levelled within a HOURS. It is imperative that these creatures must be KILLED ON SIGHT no amount of barriers will contain them as they feed off of the energy and no wall can contain them for long. 
As for the mutation itself in its incomplete form there are hopes to Stall it. When I say this do not think of this as hope there is no chance for these creatures at this point. If you are to utter something of significant value to the creature from before the mutation takes hold it may give you a brief moment to attack unhindered but after you use this opportunity the likelihood that you will get this chance again dwindles to near impossible.  
When this deep into the mutation the mind is effectively deceased as the corruption takes hold. The body will begin to mutate twisting the form and creating extra appendages or other features all over the body with seemingly no reason. Parts of the body will tear to make way for new organs or to extend the creatures reach, blades and spikes burst from the skin making it deadly in combat as their muscles grow ten times in strength. 
All I can say is if you are ever in an encounter with one of these creatures do not show mercy and do not hesitate to put this creature down.

# Stage 5

![Stage five of Stellite poisoning-min.png](/img/user/All/Stage%20five%20of%20Stellite%20poisoning-min.png)

>[!Transcript]
All I  can say is if you see someone in this state just Run there is 
nothing you can do unless you have an army. That is all that will help in 
this scenario. I wish i could be of more use but that is all I can do to help.
If you ----(Burned)---- <!-- are unfortunate enough to be in the --> situation where you are encountering
one of ----(Burned)----<!--these creatures then i suggest long--> ranged attacks and make sure to

## Prevention

There are no ways known as of yet to fully prevent the effects or Stellite or contain them However over time there have been some minor breakthroughs in the strange material that can slow the effect of this material on the body. 
Filters can be added to masks to cleanse the air of [[All/The Umbra\|The Umbra]] at least partially however for this effect to work these masks require a small sacrifice of blood to attune to the user. This in combination with other herbs and magics placed within the mask grant a brief reprieve from [[All/The Umbra\|The Umbra]] allowing short excursions into [[All/The Umbra\|The Umbra]] (generally1-2 hours). After this the mask becomes ineffective meaning that normal side effects will take place. 

In regards to containment of Stellite there is no current way to fully contain the material but there is ways to dampen its effect. Generally thick walls of lead or palladium can severely dampen the materials corrupting effect but this doesn't prevent the twisting of the mind and the insanity this material causes. 
As of current cities have found burying the material deep in the crust of the plane beneath the city or far away from the city is the best way to remove this material from grasp. 
These dumping zones are generally called [[All/Exclusion zones\|Exclusion zones]] and are heavily guarded to prevent this material getting into the wrong hands.

# Rumours

#### Stellite Power

It is rumoured by many people that if cautiously ingested in small amounts this material can grant power and strength without most of the major downsides of the material. As this material is heavily guarded and illegal to own never mind ingest, not many people confirm whether this is true but there are a large number of missing people cases.

#### Strange Voices

Across the many counts of people being partially corrupted across [[All/Palladius\|Palladius]] there have been a select few who say they heard an actual voice talking to them not just nonsensical whispering. They describe it as a deep reverberating voice that makes them sick to their stomach. This voice is said to be the reason many people commit some form of crime when experiencing Stellite corruption, as it mutters words of command to them. However nothing as of current has been confirmed.
