A long time ago Palladius was a profiting jewel, a plane blessed by a god and beautiful in kind. Thriving [[All/Cities of Palladius\|Cities of Palladius]], bustling trade routes and deep rich culture. The people of the land harvested rich materials from the ground advanced their technologies and brought to life a whole host of wonders. Watching over this plane was a goddess named [[Npcs/Estelle\|Estelle]], the god of the [[All/Sun\|Sun]]. Her beautiful form shone over the inhabitants of Palladius providing light food and warmth to this jewel of a plane.  

This all changed upon "[[All/The Day Of Oblivion\|The Day Of Oblivion]]" 
***

Upon this day like any other the god announced that they must leave to battle an evil far worse than anyone can imagine. So the god left taking her light with her but all was not lost the people of Palladius knew their god would return. To aid in their war the people held feasts and celebrations in their name hoping this would grant her even a small morsel of power. These celebrations however fettled, over time doubt set in. 

Upon one random day weeks after her departure her form re-constituted within the sky and with it her light. However something seemed off. The once brilliant light of [[Npcs/Estelle\|Estelle]] now had dimmed due to the massive toll upon her body within this war. [[Npcs/Estelle\|Estelle]]reassured the people of Palladius all was well however unbeknownst to even the god herself something was amiss. Upon her destruction within the war a [[All/Seed of evil\|Seed of evil]] was infused into her very essence. 

A brief period of triumph was had celebrating the great return of [[Npcs/Estelle\|Estelle]], this was unfortunately short lived. Soon after her return a cry of pain ripped across the plane as [[Npcs/Estelle\|Estelle]] was obliterated by this seed bringing about an endless period of darkness and twilight. In this darkness [[All/The forces of the night\|The forces of the night]] roam freely and without limits. To add insult to injury descending from the sky came a silvery black [[All/The Umbra\|mist]] and what is now dubbed [[All/Stellite\|Stellite]] with the latter being both corrupting but incredibly powerful.

What is left of Palladius now clings onto life within bastions and fortresses however one stands far taller than the rest. [[All/The Stygian City\|The Stygian City]], what is now deemed to be the last hope of mortality, holds mysteries untold.
