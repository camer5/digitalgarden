# Description

This figure stands at roughly 7ft 8" tall and has a well defined muscular form clearly built through work and battle. Their skin is a warm dark golden brown, across their skin you see a multitude of metallic golden patterns but around their eyes and spreading from their mouth and up their arms are thin black cracks that widen towards their base. In various patches of their skin you also see a discolouration almost as if the areas are more pale or devoid of some colour. Their hair is a beautiful almost metallic golden colour rich in nature that darkens towards the tips as it is tied in a Nordic style their hair naturally curly and platted close to the skin at one side. What stands out about them other than their stature is that of their face. They bare 2 sets of eyes being four in total with the second set just below where a normal set of eyes would be. Furthermore, their eyes are a solid metallic gold with hints of black cracks spreading from the corner of their glowing eyes.
