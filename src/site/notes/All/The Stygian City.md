# The Stygian City 

![monolith.png](/img/user/All/monolith.png)
***

A last hope for mortality. A roughly carved complex interweaved society has formed upon false promises and betrayal and yet, somehow this is the best hope. An indeterminate amount of time after [[All/The Day Of Oblivion\|The Day Of Oblivion]] a monolith appeared fracturing the land around it as if a wound in this planes surface. [[The Stygian Sepulchre\|The Stygian Sepulchre]], a relic of unknown origin or age materialised with an aura of protection, warding away [[All/The forces of the night\|The forces of the night]]. Naturally mortality flocked to this monument even if they couldn't comprehend its purpose. This monolith of infinite height and indescribable visage became a beacon of hope for all those near and thus founded the Stygian City.

## Hierarchy

Massive changes to the plane of [[All/Palladius\|Palladius]] have ravaged the plane of most natural resources meaning that those who control the resources control the city. This need for food and other fundamentals has created an oligarchy called [[All/The Magistrates\|The Magistrates]]. A council of those who can provide the most resources to the city are betrothed the most power to change the city. This oligarchic leadership incentivises innovation and creation of new technologies and magics to progress the stygian city allowing it to flourish. In spite of this much like any other form of rulership a deep routed corruption has set in putrefying the good intentions of the hierarchy upon its founding. 

A table of 8 guilds control the power within the stygian city pushing rules and regulations forth twisting and controlling their power to best suit their personal comforts and goals. However corrupt these guild leaders are they have the power and influence to ensure that they cannot be dethroned. Through the deep seated connections with criminals and assassins they shoot down or steal form anyone that poses as a threat to their organisations. 

Within [[All/The Magistrates\|The Magistrates]] there is a further struggle for power as those who produce the most resources within the city, earning the most money hold more votes. This creates a further hierarchy within even the most powerful, this leads to espionage and betrayal but also the creation of pacts and deals to push one another further up the food chain. 

See "[[All/The Magistrates\|The Magistrates]]" for more information about these guilds and who their leaders are.

## The Sepulchre

A monolith of infinite height sits within the centre of this city warding away any [[All/The forces of the night\|creatures of the night]], this has created an almost cult following that study and probe the monolith and its powers for information. Not only has this sepulchre become an almost religious entity but it also provides the structure and foundation for many buildings especially within [[The slums\|The slums]]. This artefact of an unknown origin is now the root of many [[strange traditions\|strange traditions]] and obsessions within the people of not only the Stygian City but also the people of [[All/Palladius\|Palladius]].

Furthermore due to its strange properties [[All/The Martyrs\|The Martyrs]] have created a headquarters within the [[The Stygian Sepulchre\|Sepulchre]] acting as a origin point for raids and defence against [[All/The forces of the night\|The forces of the night]] and even [[All/Star Spawn\|Star Spawn]]. 

Near to the induction of the [[The Stygian Sepulchre\|Sepulchre]] what was the beginnings of [[All/The Martyrs\|The Martyrs]] found an entrance deep below the surface to the internals of this artefact. Exploring its internal workings they deemed it the safest and strongest fortress to base this organisation within. Now infrastructure has been created to allow the easy access to its entrance to those who are permitted to.

## City Structure 

This City is arranged into 4 quadrants that originally were separated by class/ income. With all of these districts there is a guarded travel policy. If you are trying to go from an upper district to a lower district then there is no restrictions but coming from down up there is. Generally unless seeking pasage to a gate there is a restricted travel permit that prevents or restricts the acess these areas.  
#### The Slums

[[The slums\|The slums]] is an interconnected mass of buildings and alleyways that form a labyrinths of streets, corners, markets and roads. Within [[The slums\|The slums]] there are 3 sections. The flats and the stack and the depths, the flats are a large section of shoddy thrown together houses quickly built and stacked to house as many people as possible. Then there is the stack in which a towering metropolis has been created over many years of people building as high as possible as quick as possible. This has created a tower of buildings that sway in the wind and has collapsed many times. Within the stack there is also many buildings that lean upon the sepulchre as this is the only way for the buildings to stay upright. Finally there is the depths which is a series of buildings suspended within the cracks and crevices of the Stygian City. Hanging buildings and walkways are suspended above the seemingly endless depths of these ravines. Generally this is one of the places people try to avoid as there is a strange presence that leaks from the depths driving people insane. 

#### The Workman's District 

After this there is [[The workman's district\|The workman's district]] a middle class district mostly dedicated to the main production of artisanal goods and trade. Much like [[The slums\|The slums]] this is a dense network of streets but with a much more rigid design built upon mostly sound foundations. 

#### The Quarentine District

At one point in time [[The workman's district\|The workman's district]] had a twin dedicated to much of the similar crafts but with a more magical twinge studying the arcane and magics of this plane trying to decipher the truth behind these magical artefacts that grace the plane. All was well till a [[Vein Rot\|horrible plague]] surfaced. This [[Vein Rot\|plague]] originated from [[The slums\|The slums]] and quickly spread to [[The Quarantine District\|The other middle class district]] as the people of the [[The slums\|The slums]] fled looking for aid to cure their ilness. The plague was named [[Vein Rot\|Vein Rot]] as it quickly spread overwhealming even the magical healing that [[The Quarantine District\|The Quarantine District]] was renown for. Ever since the district has been coordened off to prevent the spread of this disease and any of thoese who enter or exit there that are seen by any form of authority have the jurisdiction to kill on sight.

#### The Palladium District

Well carved and thought out buildings line the streets of this district as [[The Palladium District\|The Palladium District]] is the zone for the upper class and [[All/The Magistrates\|The Magistrates]]. Living here provides a severly different experience to the other districts by far. The streets are mostly clean there is little petty crime and the infrastructure is well maintained. To live here is the dream of 90% of the people within this city. 
A futher benefit of living in this district there are lots of general anemities that most in the others dont get. For instance the acess to water is an automatic thing within most of the buildings within this district. However this water isnt for free generally there is a form of contract that happens with the businesses and [[The Resivoiur Guild\|The Resivoiur Guild]] to make special arrangements.
