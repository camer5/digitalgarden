***
## Overview
These foul beasts are the result of a creature being mutated beyond normal limits causing them to collapse into a corrupted hulk with no logical form. As a result of this these creatures generally are incredibly dangerous as there is no logic to their morphology or anatomy, this means that this creature is impossible to predict. They seemingly have no needs and exist purely to destroy with no purpose otherwise. 
So far from the limited encounters with these creatures nobody has managed to determine if these creatures feel anything at all or even posses thought even in its most basic form. 
***
## Mutation
As a result of their mass mutation in the prior stages of [[All/Stellite\|Stellite]] corruption their form is incredibly strong however progressing into this final stage locks in their form. As a result of their form no longer mutating these creatures become familiar with their form and become ever more proficient and deadly. 
It is theorised that the reason these creatures no longer mutate upon becoming a Star spawn is because the body has become one with the [[All/Stellite\|Stellite]]. Effectively meaning they do not suffer the ill effects of [[All/Stellite\|Stellite]] stopping the mutations. 
This lack of continued mutation has meant that these Star spawn are able to be given a classification or title and categorised. However, this does not mean that all of the abilities of the creature have been discovered and therefore are still very dangerous.

## Size
Overall there is no distinct size that fits all Star spawn however most Star spawn fall into one of 3 categories. These categories being [[All/Star Spawn#Large\|Large]], [[All/Star Spawn#Massive\|Massive]] and [[All/Star Spawn#Immense\|Immense]]. Each of these sizes are a general classification and encompass a range of sizes and are non-rigid. This means that something that is technically the size of a massive Star spawn through square footage may be placed into a bigger or smaller category depending on strength and other size attributes (i.e.. length being a contributor). Furthermore these sizes do not directly correlate to danger as well but generally the bigger the creature the more dangerous. 

### Large
![Pasted image 20250810215956.png|right|250](/img/user/All/Pasted%20image%2020250810215956.png)This size range generally encompasses 10sqft and up to 15-25sqft generally this equates to the Dnd sizes of large to gargantuan these creatures are generally about the size of a smaller [[Workmans district\|Workmans district]] house. These creatures are the most common size of Star spawn however are still not to be trifled with. Within a day one of these creatures can destroy a city if not dealt with properly.
### Massive
![Vitousek_WhaleImage.png|right|300](/img/user/All/Vitousek_WhaleImage.png)The Massive size category generally covers the range of 25sqft up to 40-50sqft. This range is much larger generally, this is because the next jump in scale is much larger. Generally these creatures are about the height of a 4 story tall building but that is dependant on other factors as well. Massive Star spawn are very rare and are the limit of what a city can defeat before loosing itself. There are only 3 known of in existence as of current and as such have been given fitting names. 

#### The Black Maw
![hellhound_orig.jpg|right|300](/img/user/All/hellhound_orig.jpg)This is a basic rendition of what people describe the Black Maw to be similar too. This creature measures in at 30ft tall and 50ft long. Wielding massive muscles and a maw that stretches down more than half of the body of this creature with incredible teeth at its disposal. At points on its body spines and tendrils pierce the skin of this creature as within its mouth there are large eyes along the inside of the mouth. This creature seemingly has an endless appetite and can eat an apparent infinite amount. At the end of this creatures long spiny tail is another mouth and coming from witch is a bone spike attached to a tongue of sorts.
#### The Aberrant Drake
![Abberant wail.png|right|400](/img/user/All/Abberant%20wail.png) This creature appears draconic in its original form but since has mutated almost beyond recognition. This creature has only been spotted twice and is incredibly dangerous. It stands at 50ft tall with hulking muscles multiple arms and a set of membranous wings that bear a fleshy peach tone. Its left arm has fused into a single head from the centre of which a barbed tendril protrudes. From the lowest of its right arms the hand has formed into what looks to be a combination of a mouth and a hand from which again another tendril protrudes this time slick and muscular. Upon its other elongated arms the limb forms into a long blade splitting from the middle of the forearm and through the middle digits of the hand. It is unknown if this creature bears a breath weapon but what is known is this creature shows some minor form of intelligence making it all the more devastating. 
#### The Monstrous Wyrm 
![literal_wyrm_by_demonml_dco89vw-pre.jpg|right|350](/img/user/All/literal_wyrm_by_demonml_dco89vw-pre.jpg) The Monstrous Wyrm is an unpredictable and devastating creature if not handled properly. The Wyrm is over 80ft long and is 15ft thick whilst having a pair of arms near the creatures head. Its head is split 8 ways and is bladed whilst simultaneously being covered in eyes. Within the creatures maw there are thousands of teeth and at the centre of its maw is the upper torso of a humanoid. The arms of this creature are tipped with sharp claws and are covered in spines and armour plates. Coming from the shoulder area/neck of this creature are thick muscular tendrils that help pull the creature along above the ground. 

### Immense
![dragon-size-chart-smaug-colour.webp|right|350](/img/user/All/dragon-size-chart-smaug-colour.webp)This category is specifically for creatures that through no amount of force can be defeated. Creatures of this size start at a minimum of 50-100sqft but there is no upper limit to this size category. As of current there is one documented and known of immense star spawn. Its name is [[All/The Creeping Mass\|The Creeping Mass]]. The mass is a miles wide creature/ organism responsible for devastating a huge portion of [[All/Palladius\|Palladius]]. Apart from this creature there are no other known immense category Star spawn but some have been theorised.

## Where?

Thankfully these creatures are incredibly rare to find but vast quantities of people or magic can sometimes attract them however this as of current is just a very likely theory. Out in the wilds there is no rhyme or reason to where you would find one of these creatures but generally once you have located one of these creatures they generally don't tend to wander far. These creatures seem to have some sort of patrolling area whether that is a remnant of the last parts of the consciousness of the creature it was before or whether this is because of some sort of command directing them it is impossible to tell. The only creature/organism that remains in one place is that of [[All/The Creeping Mass\|The Creeping Mass]] spreading from [[All/Ceres\|Ceres]].

# Rumours
#### Star Spawn Control
Upon the destruction of a minor town upon [[All/Palladius\|Palladius]] the Star Spawn destroying the town displayed odd behaviour. A group of people noticed that during the fight it seemed as if the creature was listening to something. However nobody within the group could hear any noise other than the creature itself. After the creature stopped "listening" to the noise its behaviour rapidly changed and the creature fled the scene. Perhaps this was happenstance or just some odd quirk of how this creature functioned but it begs the question. What if there is something controlling them...? 

#### Something Stronger Than A Star Spawn?
Whenever there is a strong foe to be felled there is always the question within every bodies mind. What if this is only the beginning? This is not a popular rumour but a few religious zealots and psychics have said they have had visions of a stronger force but whether these "visions" are to be trusted is questionable at best.
