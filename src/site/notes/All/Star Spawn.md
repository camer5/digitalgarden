## Overview
These foul beasts are the result of a creature being mutated beyond normal limits causing them to collapse into a corrupted hulk with no logical form. As a result of this these creatures generally are incredibly dangerous as there is no logic to their morphology or anatomy, this means that this creature is impossible to predict. They seemingly have no needs and exist purely to destroy with no purpose otherwise. 
So far from the limited encounters with these creatures nobody has managed to determine if these creatures feel anything at all or even posses thought even in its most basic form.

## Mutation
As a result of their mass mutation in the prior stages of [[All/Stellite\|Stellite]] corruption their form is incredibly strong however progressing into this final stage locks in their form. As a result of their form no longer mutating these creatures become familiar with their form and become ever more proficient and deadly. 
It is theorised that the reason these creatures no longer mutate upon becoming a Star spawn is because the body has become one with the [[All/Stellite\|Stellite]]. Effectively meaning they do not suffer the ill effects of [[All/Stellite\|Stellite]] stopping the mutations. 
This lack of continued mutation has meant that these Star spawn are able to be given a classification or title and categorised. However, this does not mean that all of the abilities of the creature have been discovered and therefore are still very dangerous.

## Size
Overall there is no distinct size that fits all Star spawn however most Star spawn fall into one of 3 categories. These categories being [[All/Star Spawn#Large\|Large]], [[All/Star Spawn#Massive\|Massive]] and [[All/Star Spawn#Immense\|Immense]]. Each of these sizes are a general classification and encompass a range of sizes and are non-rigid. This means that something that is technically the size of a massive Star spawn through square footage may be placed into a bigger or smaller category depending on strength and other size attributes (i.e.. length being a contributor). Furthermore these sizes do not directly correlate to danger as well but generally the bigger the creature the more dangerous. 

### Large
![Pasted image 20250810215956.png|right|250](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020250810215956.png)This size range generally encompasses 10sqft and up to 15-25sqft generally this equates to the Dnd sizes of large to gargantuan these creatures are generally about the size of a smaller [[Workmans district\|Workmans district]] house. These creatures are the most common size of Star spawn however are still not to be trifled with. Within a day one of these creatures can destroy a city if not dealt with properly.
### Massive
![Vitousek_WhaleImage.png|right|300](/img/user/Vitousek_WhaleImage.png)The Massive size category generally covers the range of 25sqft up to 40-50sqft. This range is much larger generally, this is because the next jump in scale is much larger. Generally these creatures are about the height of a 4 story tall building but that is dependant on other factors as well. Massive Star spawn are very rare and are the limit of what a city can defeat before loosing itself. There are only 4 known of in existence as of current and as such have been given fitting names.
