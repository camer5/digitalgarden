# The landscape of Palladius
***

[[Palladius\|Palladius]] was once a landscape of untold riches and bounty flourishing with nature and fauna dotted with towering cities and settlements of untold size. There wasn't a place upon [[Palladius\|Palladius]] that you couldn't thrive and do whatever you wished. The marvel that was this plane was often shown with the strange magical devices, spells, technology and more but that all changed upon [[The Day Of Oblivion\|The Day Of Oblivion]].

Now however [[Palladius\|Palladius]] is a barren wasteland of large stony deserts separated by [[Gravewoods\|Gravewoods]] and towering ruins. Not only did the god [[Estelle\|Estelle]] die upon that fateful day but the plane itself. 

The terrain fractured in a temper tantrum as fissures opened and with them came [[The forces of the night\|The forces of the night]]. Pouring out of these cracks were creatures unseen before this and only rumoured in history books of a time long since past. 

Furthermore, to add to this rending of the plane came [[Stellite\|Stellite]] and [[The Umbra\|The Umbra]] two sides of the same coin yet both just as deadly. These forces fell from the sky now infecting the landscape around them twisting it and distorting the already broken copse of this plane. 

Because of these events the terrain within this plane is in a constant state of flux ever so slightly shifting as the whims of the universe warp the ground beneath you. However even in this state of change there remains a rationality to the plane as if it claws and fights back trying to attain the beauty it once had. 

To adventure into this plane is to explore and to find both wonders and horrors of which the mind cannot comprehend but to do so one must survive the dangers that await you.

## The black desert

Due to the nature of this plane and its [[Sun\|Sun]] half of this plane is surrounded in constant darkness. This is because of the lack of a daylight cycle meaning that the [[Sun\|Sun]] no longer moves across the sky to bless even the remnants of its power upon the ground. This creates a zone perfect for [[The forces of the night\|The forces of the night]] to flourish. This side of the plane is called [[The Black desert\|The Black desert]] and it is a side of the plane that no mortal should ever travel too as it is certain to cut their life short.

## Crypts

Upon the day [[Estelle\|Estelle]] fell [[Stellite\|Stellite]] and its [[The Umbra\|counterpart]] created zones now dubbed as [[Crypts\|Crypts]]. These [[Crypts\|Crypts]] ward away life with their mutagenic powers creating barren zones where nothing now lives and is excruciatingly quiet. 

These zones have no rhyme or reason for their positioning and are just where these forces fell. However [[The Umbra\|Umbra]] patches have a tendency to wander.

# Rumours

#### Old cities

It is said that old cities and towns within these [[Crypts\| Crypt]] zones are filled with treasures untold and sights you are unlikely to find anywhere else on this plane. But these treasures come with a risk unlike any other as [[The forces of the night\|The forces of the night]] and [[Star Spawn\|Star Spawn]] are common within these zones. Accompanied by the mutagenic influence of [[Stellite\|Stellite]] and its counterpart make these places something not to be trifled with

#### A Strange Presence

People upon traveling between [[Cities of Palladius\|cities]] that strayed to far from the beaten path have reported a strange presence coming from deep below the surface of the plane. This energy slips between the cracks of the plane and seeps out of the ravines and crevasses of the landscape. However none of these folk have been brave enough or strong enough to venture further.
