***

Estelle was the god of sunlight on [[Palladius\|Palladius]], creating a warming glow of energy that rippled across the plane. Her resplendent form prevented the forces of evil from invading the surface of [[Palladius\|Palladius]] protecting the inhabitancy of [[Palladius\|Palladius]] safe from [[The forces of the night\|The forces of the night]]. 

However this all changed upon [[The Day Of Oblivion\|The Day Of Oblivion]] in which she informed the people of [[Palladius\|Palladius]] that there is a war with a creature of unfathomable evil that has come into being and that she must go to help the war effort against them.

>  <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">“My children I must go, there has awoken a being of unfathomable evil, darker and hungrier than any beast you can imagine. I must help others of the realms to slay this creature before it becomes too powerful. I will leave you with a portion of my light but I need as much strength as I can muster. But in my time away I implore you to enjoy yourself and pay no heed to the thoughts in your mind. I shall return soon” </span>
