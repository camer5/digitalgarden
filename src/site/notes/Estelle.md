# Estelle
***

Estelle was the god of sunlight on [[Palladius\|Palladius]], creating a warming glow of energy that rippled across the plane. Her resplendent form prevented the forces of evil from invading the surface of [[Palladius\|Palladius]] protecting the inhabitancy of [[Palladius\|Palladius]] safe from [[The forces of the night\|The forces of the night]]. 

However this all changed upon [[The Day Of Oblivion\|The Day Of Oblivion]] in which she informed the people of [[Palladius\|Palladius]] that there is a war with a creature of unfathomable evil that has come into being and that she must go to help the war effort against them.

>  <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">“My children I must go, there has awoken a being of unfathomable evil, darker and hungrier than any beast you can imagine. I must help others of the realms to slay this creature before it becomes too powerful. I will leave you with a portion of my light but I need as much strength as I can muster. But in my time away I implore you to enjoy yourself and pay no heed to the thoughts in your mind. I shall return soon” </span>

>This was quoted from the remnants of a holy text found within the ruin of [[Irongrave\|Irongrave]] by the famous scholar **[[Thastar gulvack\|Thastar gulvack]]** and has since been scribed into the vaults of both [[The Martyrs\|The Martyrs]] and [[The Stygian City\|The Stygian City]]

As stated by this text Estelle left for war and implored in her absence to feast to grant her strength. We know now that this strength given was however not enough. Upon her arrival the usual warm light that Estelle emits was weakened. It is presumed that there was some reassurance from the god to why her light was dimmed but as of current no information regarding this topic has been found.

Unbeknownst to the god and all of her followers upon her destruction within the war the creature that defeated her implanted a [[Seed of evil\|Seed of evil]]. This very seed fused with her essence, her being, permanently affixing to her form. As time passed this seed grew silently until the very end of [[The Day Of Oblivion\|The Day Of Oblivion]] in which the seed detonated.

Seemingly due to the death of Estelle this strange metal and mist descended from the sky and from the corpse of Estelle however this has yet to be confirmed but the death of Estelle is the only current origin theory for [[Stellite\|Stellite]] thus gaining its namesake. As mentioned above and within the quoted text [[Stellite\|Stellite]] was accompanied by a silvery black mist which has been dubbed [[The Umbra\|The Umbra]] by [[Umbra Vistryn\|Umbra Vistryn]] the guild master of [[The Archanist Guild\|The Archanist Guild]]. Both the metal and the mist have strange corrupting properties generally mutating and warping all those who interact with it whilst driving them insane.

### Post death 

After the death of Estelle the plane of [[Palladius\|Palladius]] has fallen into a permanent twilight where the [[Sun\|Sun]] never sets therefore permanently changing the [[Landscape\|Landscape]] of [[Palladius\|Palladius]]. The lack of this sunlight has lead to the rising of [[The forces of the night\|The forces of the night]], these forces ripped through the commonwealth of [[Palladius\|Palladius]] within the first 100 or so years causing a permanent change to the [[Daily life\|Daily life]] of an average dweller. 

Eventually after many failed attempts the people of [[Palladius\|Palladius]] have managed to stabilize partially and form a few [[Cities of Palladius\|bastions/cities]]. These cities now are seemingly the last hope for [[Palladius\|Palladius]].

# Rumours

#### The Sacrament

Within many texts across the plane there are strange references to a group called [[The Sacrament\|The Sacrament]] which many say are the lost 3 daughters of Estelle. These rumours have yet to be confirmed officially but many have been quoted to believe that these sisters exist and are amongst us. 

Furthermore, many believe that these 3 sisters are the face sides of the [[Coinage\|Coinage]] within Palladius however it seems as if most knowledge of these sisters has been removed from records. However it does seemingly have many roots in truth and has evidence to prove that such rumours could be true.

#### The cult of the Eclipse

There are many [[Cults\|Cults]] and religions within [[Palladius\|Palladius]] however the [[Cults\|cult]] that proves to be most plausible is [[The Cult Of The Eclipse\|The Cult Of The Eclipse]]. It is said that this cult is trying to find a way to resurrect the dead body of Estelle to grant prosperity to [[Palladius\|Palladius]] once more.  

This [[Cults\|cult]] is sited to be one of the possible reasons for a couple of disappearances within [[The Stygian City\|The Stygian City]] and potentially the disappearance of [[Cearus\|Cearus]] the [[Tieflings of Palladius\|Tiefling]] noble.
