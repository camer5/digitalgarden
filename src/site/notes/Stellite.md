## an overview

Stellite appears to be a metal with otherworldly properties. Many of which are unfavourable to the living.

These [[Crypts\|Crypts]] can be formed for a number of reasons one of them being the presence of [[The Umbra\|The Umbra]] a silvery black mist that shares similar properties to Stellite but in a much larger area and to a weaker effect. Another reason for these [[Crypts\|Crypts]] can be the presence
