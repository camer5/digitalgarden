Augustus Halt is as of current the guild leader for the [[AA Player links/City Enforcers\|City Enforcers]] managing all of their pay and which jobs are to be undertaken by any member of the guild. He is well known to be a corrupt figure within the city and often will take bribes to further his own gain preventing investigation into cases throughout the city. 

When it comes to his lineage little is known of him, he leads a very secretive lifestyle behind closed doors and is not know to have any descendants. Generally this is no strange feat but what is out of the ordinary is that he seemingly hasn't aged in the past 50 years and no reason can be found appearing to only be 50 years of age by his appearance. Another strange oddity of him is that outside of his guild work he is never seen within the city and there are no records of his parents.
<!-- He is currently in league with [[AA Player links/The Cult Of The Eclipse\|The Cult Of The Eclipse]] and has been working with them for many years to extend his life an sway attention away from any work carried out by them--> 
Some people suspect he is in league with one of the criminal organisations but nothing can be confirmed as of current.
