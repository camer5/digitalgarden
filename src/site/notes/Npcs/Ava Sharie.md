Ava is the young elven servant found within [[Npcs/Aquilan wyntris\|Aquilan wyntris]]' home after the attack by the [[Npcs/Mysterious Figure\|Mysterious Figure]] in [[Player Session Notes/Session 2\|Session 2]]. The party found her shell shocked and in tattered clothing with a very deep wound across their neck that if she hadn't applied pressure would have died mere moments later. As of current she hasn't responded to any questioning regarding the incident but medical staff within [[AA Player links/The Martyrs\|The Martyrs]] are hopeful she will make a full recovery soon.
