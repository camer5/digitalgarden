The Guard within the city generally are a mix of mercenaries and other under skilled individuals. This force is in place to help maintain the peace and handle petty measures within the city. Another important part of their job within the city is to guard the checkpoints between [[AA Player links/The Stygian City#City Structure\|districts]] and ensure that anyone passing by is meant to be there. Because of this it has lead to mass corruption within the force as this guild is underfunded and generally unable to stay fully afloat due to the presence of [[AA Player links/The Martyrs\|The Martyrs]]. 

Whenever encountering any form of force or case the city enforcers will generally deal with these issues however if it is deemed a sufficiently dangerous situation [[AA Player links/The Martyrs\|The Martyrs]] can seize control of any case. Because of this there is a deep seated rivalry between these two guilds as [[AA Player links/The Martyrs\|The Martyrs]] guild holds more power and therefore takes precedent. Over the years a slang term [[AA Player links/The Martyrs\|"leechers"]] has been created by the city guard referring to [[AA Player links/The Martyrs\|The Martyrs]] steeling or "leeching" their cases. 

One of the main reasons this rivalry is so important to the city enforcers is that any case completed by a guild will be rewarded with gold in recompense for the expenditure of resources. Therefore whenever a case is taken from the city enforcers money is also taken thus causing the anguish.

This guild is bankrolled and also directed by an individual called [[Npcs/Augustus Halt\|Augustus Halt]] who manages all of the movement of funding and decided how much people are paid. [[Npcs/Augustus Halt\|Augustus Halt]] also manages any sort of meeting that may happen within the guilds of the city but due to his guild currently being less influential than others, it is not upon [[AA Player links/The Magistrates\|The Magistrates]] table.
