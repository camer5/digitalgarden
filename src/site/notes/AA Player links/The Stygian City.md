# The Stygian City 

![monolith.png](/img/user/Images/monolith.png)
***
## Overview
A last hope for mortality. A roughly carved complex interweaved society has formed upon false promises and betrayal and yet, somehow this is the best hope. An indeterminate amount of time after [[AA Player links/The Day Of Oblivion\|The Day Of Oblivion]] a monolith appeared fracturing the land around it as if a wound in this planes surface. [[AA Player links/The Stygian Sepulchre\|The Stygian Sepulchre]], a relic of unknown origin or age materialised with an aura of protection, warding away [[AA Player links/The forces of the night\|The forces of the night]]. Naturally mortality flocked to this monument even if they couldn't comprehend its purpose. This monolith of infinite height and indescribable visage became a beacon of hope for all those near and thus founded the Stygian City.

After hundreds of years of development with varying degrees of success and corruption rife within the city a balance has been found. Whether that be squeezing through the dense shoulder to shoulder [[AA Player links/The slums\|slums]] as you keep your head on a swivel looking for thieves murderers of pickpockets fearing for your life as you cross bridges and walkways so thin a twitch could bring the walkway down. Or as you meander through the labyrinth of [[AA Player links/The workman's district\|The workman's district]] ducking and dodging the hanging cables, pipes and conduits grasping for air as a smog smothers the street you found yourself in stumbling off the beaten path. Maybe the balance you see is in the well crafted buildings of [[AA Player links/The Palladium District\|The Palladium District]] well thought out and logically placed streets of large ostentatious mansions with water to the premises and lavish furniture. Wherever this balance is or how it was achieved is no longer relevant all that matters now is survival and climbing the ladder of importance. 

To further add to the mysticism of the city and how its inner workings function is [[AA Player links/The Stygian Sepulchre\|The Stygian Sepulchre]] itself. A monolith of crystal like material that whispers within the nightmares of all who live within its presence. However those who have been born within the safety of these walls have learned to silence the dread and unease this artefact brings. 
***

## Hierarchy

Massive changes to the plane of [[AA Player links/Palladius\|Palladius]] have ravaged the plane of most natural resources meaning that those who control the resources control the city. This need for food and other fundamentals has created an oligarchy called [[AA Player links/The Magistrates\|The Magistrates]]. A council of those who can provide the most resources to the city are betrothed the most power to change the city. This oligarchic leadership incentivises innovation and creation of new technologies and magics to progress the stygian city allowing it to flourish. In spite of this much like any other form of rulership a deep routed corruption has set in putrefying the good intentions of the hierarchy upon its founding. 

A table of 8 guilds control the power within the stygian city pushing rules and regulations forth twisting and controlling their power to best suit their personal comforts and goals. However corrupt these guild leaders are they have the power and influence to ensure that they cannot be dethroned. Through the deep seated connections with criminals and assassins they shoot down or steal form anyone that poses as a threat to their organisations. 

Within [[AA Player links/The Magistrates\|The Magistrates]] there is a further struggle for power as those who produce the most resources within the city, earning the most money hold more votes. This creates a further hierarchy within even the most powerful, this leads to espionage and betrayal but also the creation of pacts and deals to push one another further up the food chain. 

See "[[AA Player links/The Magistrates\|The Magistrates]]" for more information about these guilds and who their leaders are.
***
## The Sepulchre

A monolith of infinite height sits within the centre of this city warding away any [[AA Player links/The forces of the night\|creatures of the night]], this has created an almost cult following that study and probe the monolith and its powers for information. Not only has this sepulchre become an almost religious entity but it also provides the structure and foundation for many buildings especially within [[AA Player links/The slums\|The slums]]. This artefact of an unknown origin is now the root of many [[AA Player links/strange traditions\|strange traditions]] and obsessions within the people of not only the Stygian City but also the people of [[AA Player links/Palladius\|Palladius]].

Furthermore due to its strange properties [[AA Player links/The Martyrs\|The Martyrs]] have created a headquarters within the [[AA Player links/The Stygian Sepulchre\|Sepulchre]] acting as a origin point for raids and defence against [[AA Player links/The forces of the night\|The forces of the night]] and even [[AA Player links/Star Spawn\|Star Spawn]]. 

Near to the induction of the [[AA Player links/The Stygian Sepulchre\|Sepulchre]] what was the beginnings of [[AA Player links/The Martyrs\|The Martyrs]] found an entrance deep below the surface to the internals of this artefact. Exploring its internal workings they deemed it the safest and strongest fortress to base this organisation within. Now infrastructure has been created to allow the easy access to its entrance to those who are permitted to.
***
## City Structure 

This City is arranged into 4 quadrants that originally were separated by class/ income. With all of these districts there is a guarded travel policy. If you are trying to go from an upper district to a lower district then there is no restrictions but coming from down up there is. Generally unless seeking passage to a gate there is a restricted travel permit that prevents or restricts the access these areas by [[AA Player links/City Enforcers\|City Enforcers]].  

#### The Slums

[[AA Player links/The slums\|The slums]] is an interconnected mass of buildings and alleyways that form a labyrinths of streets, corners, markets and roads. Within [[AA Player links/The slums\|The slums]] there are 3 sections. The flats and the stack and the depths, the flats are a large section of shoddy thrown together houses quickly built and stacked to house as many people as possible. Then there is the stack in which a towering metropolis has been created over many years of people building as high as possible as quick as possible. This has created a tower of buildings that sway in the wind and has collapsed many times. Within the stack there is also many buildings that lean upon the sepulchre as this is the only way for the buildings to stay upright. Finally there is the depths which is a series of buildings suspended within the cracks and crevices of the Stygian City. Hanging buildings and walkways are suspended above the seemingly endless depths of these ravines. Generally this is one of the places people try to avoid as there is a strange presence that leaks from the depths driving people insane. 

#### The Workman's District 

After this there is [[AA Player links/The workman's district\|The workman's district]] a middle class district mostly dedicated to the main production of artisanal goods and trade. Tall weaved buildings stretch high into the sky with all number of supports, walkways, pipes and cables with redundancy after redundancy of old obsolete technology and magics all sloppily knitted together with a limited degree of reason. As old generations or areas die out new peoples move in building on top of the old cadavers of the cities infrastructure, as little to nothing is removed only repaired or ignored as to spend time fixing the issues or waste costs money they don't have. Although this district is just as chaotic as the [[AA Player links/The slums\|The slums]] this district has some form of rigid structure/skeleton of which the buildings grow off of. A series of pipes originating from [[AA Player links/The Carmine Guild\|The Carmine Guild]] called the [[AA Player links/Atrial network\|Atrial network]] carry steam acting as this proposed skeleton to allow the city to function. Along with the pipes from [[AA Player links/The Carmine Guild\|The Carmine Guild]] other pipes and conduits are generally bundled together to transport other important amenities like water to their distribution centres and other information. Furthermore this district is based upon trade commerce and production often being the only reason to visit and being the average citizens place of work. 

#### The Quarantine District

At one point in time [[AA Player links/The workman's district\|The workman's district]] had a twin dedicated to much of the similar crafts but with a more magical twinge studying the arcane and magics of this plane trying to decipher the truth behind these magical artefacts that grace the plane. All was well till a [[AA Player links/Vein Rot\|horrible plague]] surfaced. This [[AA Player links/Vein Rot\|plague]] originated from [[AA Player links/The slums\|The slums]] and quickly spread to [[AA Player links/The Quarantine District\|The other middle class district]] as the people of the [[AA Player links/The slums\|The slums]] fled looking for aid to cure their illness. The plague was named [[AA Player links/Vein Rot\|Vein Rot]] as it quickly spread overwhelming even the magical healing that [[AA Player links/The Quarantine District\|The Quarantine District]] was renown for. Ever since the district has been cordoned off to prevent the spread of this disease and any of those who enter or exit there that are seen by any form of authority have the jurisdiction to kill on sight.

#### The Palladium District

Well carved and thought out buildings line the streets of this district as [[AA Player links/The Palladium District\|The Palladium District]] is the zone for the upper class and [[AA Player links/The Magistrates\|The Magistrates]]. Living here provides a severely different experience to the other districts by far. The streets are mostly clean there is little petty crime and the infrastructure is well maintained. To live here is the dream of 90% of the people within this city. 
A further benefit of living in this district there are lots of general amenities that most in the others don't get. For instance the access to water is an automatic thing within most of the buildings within this district. However this water isn't for free generally there is a form of contract that happens with the businesses and [[AA Player links/The Reservoir Guild\|The Reservoir Guild]] to make special arrangements.

## Infrastructure 

### Transport
Due to the size of the stygian city traversal can be a serious issue however a number of methods have been designed to fit the terrain and scope of the distance travelled. Due to this scale the number of these transport methods is immense however many are much more reliable than others with some being incredibly dangerous.
##### by foot
Walkways and bridges are the skeleton of this city acting as an interconnected spiderweb linking all important places together. Buildings are either built with walkways in mind or are retrofitted to suit the needs of the city often being built onto the side of your home or place of work with little regard to your opinions. These walkways lead to the many levels and layers of the city however useful this tangled nest of traversal could lead many a mind mad making minor misinterpretation to memory, maybe the mending of the monotony is manufacturing a marvellous map. The only thing that interrupts this network of walkways is the fissures between the different districts and their passage control.

##### By Machine
Technology and marvellous creations are the backbone of this city not only providing wealth and knowledge but new ways to travel and traverse this city. Depending on the district you are within limits the various methods of travel. Anything from [[Images/Edifice figures\|Edifice figures]] i.e. skeletons powered by steam to step high above the crowd to [[AA Player links/Antonym Rails\|Antonym Rails]] suspended above the crowds connecting buildings and districts. New methods are appearing and vanishing almost within the blink of an eye.

##### By Creature
Within the stygian city there are a few different [[AA Player links/Fauna\|common species]] that have grown and adapted to the harsh climate of [[AA Player links/Palladius\|Palladius]]. Although these creatures have managed to find a way to survive they generally do not constitute a good meal due to the poisonous nature of their skin or their harsh magical adaptions. The most popular form of creature used to traverse is a descendant of a basilisk which has been selectively bred to remove its petrifying gaze and to increase its ability to climb. 

### Sanitation
Over a large number of years and through consistent progress and development a maze of a waste water system has been created. This network of sewer systems and water reprocessing sites have been constantly built upon and developed over many generations and as such there are many areas which have been abandoned. 

Any waste products are generally taken to a factory to be dried to reclaim the water and burned. This waste ash is then generally mixed in with other materials to make either building materials or used to fertilize crops for food.

### Energy
Through countless iterations [[AA Player links/The Carmine Guild\|The Carmine Guild]] has developed a series of pipes and cables that route around the city and link to psychic energy substations to power all number of buildings and worksites. This energy is then generally used to create light turn machinery or even used to power spells depending on the investment. 

The pipes or what [[AA Player links/The Carmine Guild\|The Carmine Guild]] refer to them as the "[[AA Player links/Atrial network\|Atrial network]]" are a guarded piece of infrastructure that links all around the city pumping steam and is a proprietary piece of technology. However the cables and conduits that reach from these substations are not. Furthermore these cables often don't need to be guarded as they are generally a very dangerous thing to be around and that alone generally wards away people.

### Water
Water is a precious commodity within [[AA Player links/Palladius\|Palladius]] and the Stygian city as when the [[AA Player links/Landscape\|Landscape]] was bombarded with [[AA Player links/Stellite\|Stellite]] it generally corrupted the water within lakes and seas making them poisonous or even entirely drying them up. So within the city's limits there are a tight network of pipes that link to multiple areas within the city for both drinking and usage. 

Water rationing centres are a structure created by [[Npcs/Lord Parfu\|Lord Parfu]] a corrupt self indulgent leader of [[AA Player links/The Reservoir Guild\|The Reservoir Guild]] renowned for his greed and selfishness. These rationing centres are distribution points for water rations used for drinking for cooking and bathing. The rationing centres require you to pay for water containers which you use to either fill your water tank or to store at home and when the containers are empty they are required to be returned to the rationing centre where they are then refilled with water. 

Around the city and sometimes outside the city [[AA Player links/The Reservoir Guild\|The Reservoir Guild]] has set up these water pumping sites that extract water from the ground and from underground water caverns. These pumps then extract the water to distribute to water storage facilities to then link to the rest of the city. The work to setup these pumping sites and the labour needed to maintain them is immense as these structures are very large and are very complicated. Often within these sites people die as they fall into machinery or are blasted by energy as the safeguards to protect people would slow down progress and cost money.

### Food
[[AA Player links/The Lifeblood guild\|The Lifeblood guild]] is the guild that produces food and organics for the Stygian city through the use of multiple different subterranean species of plant. These different organics are generally grown outside of the city and then shipped into the city through the use of multiple different caravans but certain types of food are grown within the city limits. These places are generaly chosen for their ready access to water and underground space. Any worker that works within these different sites are generally housed on site and come back in periods throughout the year. Overall there aren't many people who work on these sites and generally there is a very small amount of communication with these places and the city itself.

After the food has been created it is often shipped off to the city and then distributed in a food market in which the speciality and high quality foods are bidded for by businesses and nobles. This food is often split into mutliple different quality bands as not to clog the auction houses with people who cannot afford the bids. Most of the middle quality band food is distributed to food stalls within the market which is then cooked in a variety of different ways to be able to sell them to customers. Any low quality food that is left over is then sent to [[AA Player links/Food centres\|Food centres]] in which the food is sold to make a certain amount of profit to demand so the more poeple that buy food from these [[AA Player links/Food centres\|Food centres]] the cheaper the food. Any food that is left over from any of these is then sent to the emergency rationing station in which it is frozen and then distributed to those who make lower than a certain threshold with food tokens and the need is tailored to the family size.

### General
Within the stygian city most of the materials used for the creation of buildings comes from either the large organics trade from the [[AA Player links/The Lifeblood guild\|The Lifeblood guild]] or the waste materials from mining and the water guild. [[AA Player links/The Lifeblood guild\|The Lifeblood guild]]  not only grows all of the crops and creatures needed to sustain life but also grows large plants for use in construction. These plants range from fibrous materials like hemp used to make rope or large tree like mushrooms used as lumber and fuel for the city. The waste materials from mining are generally large stone blocks used in the construction of large and expensive [[AA Player links/The Palladium District\|The Palladium District]] buildings. For [[AA Player links/The workman's district\|The workman's district]], buildings are generally made of either small stone blocks cut from the leftovers of [[AA Player links/The Palladium District\|The Palladium District]] or are made of this special material that acts like concrete made up of a combination of various different materials which are then cut into blocks. Within [[AA Player links/The slums\|The slums]] most buildings are generally made of this mushroom wood which is incredibly quick to grow and requires next to no water to produce. These factors come together meaning these buildings often end up being quite cheap to make at the cost of a weaker building and a worse aesthetic.

## Crime
Due to the sheer volume of people and the size of the city crime has become a part of most peoples life in some way. Whether this be constantly keeping an eye in the back of your head in a hopes to avoid the crime or having to join an organisation to make ends meet. 

Within the city there are a couple of known crime organisations that people often flock to when they need something doing. However as they have such power the [[AA Player links/City Enforcers\|City Enforcers]] turn a blind eye. 

### The Myriad
[[AA Player links/The Myriad\|The Myriad]] is the most dangerous criminal organisation as of current as this organisation is composed of assassins thugs and mercenaries for hire acting as a persuasion force and also as a protective force for some of [[AA Player links/The Magistrates\|The Magistrates]] and other high nobles. 
Furthermore most of the aspiring blacksmiths arcanists and other such artisans that come up with new ideas that could improve or inspire the next generation are either "persuaded" to give over their ideas or are "cleaned up" to keep the current magistrates in power and [[AA Player links/The Myriad\|The Myriad]] are often the ones to take these jobs. It has become an almost cultural thing to keep an eye out for who is listening to you and your ideas in fear of [[AA Player links/The Myriad\|The Myriad]] coming to "acquire your talents".  

### The Sisterhood
[[AA Player links/The Sisterhood\|The Sisterhood]] is a less known organisation of elite assassins that work under their own terms and almost never take on contracts seeming trying to shape and change the face of the city. [[AA Player links/The Sisterhood\|The Sisterhood]] is made up of entirely women and selectively hires people for their ranks. Next to nothing is known of its organisational structure but what is known is that they are ruthless and merciless.

## Commodities 
Within the stygian city there are many different commodites that improve the life of civilians in some way shape or form. These have many different benefits and downsides. However to have these resources is to be good at sourcing or to have a lot of money/debt to spare.
### Drugs 
Drugs are a massive part of the culture of the Stygian city 
***
## Points of Interest
### The Market
Within [[AA Player links/The workman's district\|The workman's district]] there is a large interconnected set of streets and alleyways all dedicated to the purchasing and selling of all goods whether that be new technologies and magic items you have either found stolen or crafted or whether that be different foods and home supplies to ensure you can live. 

The market is incredibly dense with almost no way to perfectly navigate the place and with the sheer number of people constantly bumping into and walking around you it is rife with crime and pickpockets. Because of this a larger than normal amount of [[AA Player links/City Enforcers\|City Enforcers]] patrol the area.

Furthermore because of the vast nature of the market you can almost always find someone who is looking to buy what you have and you can almost always find someone who is willing to sell you what you need. 

### The Magistrates Court
Within the [[AA Player links/The workman's district\|The workman's district]] there is a reinforced building dedicated to [[AA Player links/The Magistrates\|The Magistrates]] council where they regularly convene to discuss various trade agreements and general upcoming events and trade ideas. This is a quite large building and is one of the oldest in the entire city being constructed at the founding of the city. 

### The Veiled Parlour 
This [[AA Player links/The Veiled Parlour\|Parlour]] is once again part of [[AA Player links/The workman's district\|The workman's district]] due to the high volume of people. [[AA Player links/The Veiled Parlour\|The Veiled Parlour]] is a pervasive and addictive area of the city dedicated to all of the pleasures any person could need whether that be games and alcohol or more vulgar activities. Whatever you wish for this is the place you go to fulfil any need or want.   

### The botanarium
Once a brilliant and well maintained jewel of this otherwise gruesome city [[AA Player links/The Botanarium\|The Botanarium]] was one of the only places on this plane that was able to cultivate some natural life. Within its heyday this place acted as a massive greenhouse with strange magical lights used to provide lights to these plants. Furthermore within this facility was a large section dedicated to the research and study of ways to improve the receptibility of plants within this plane. This was until a massive hoard of insect like creatures flooded [[AA Player links/The Botanarium\|The Botanarium]] killing all of the researchers and rendering the area a derelict. Every now and again people say that they see strange lights and hear noises coming from the abandoned decrepit building but there has yet to be any proof.

### The Hanging Collage 
Suspended above one of the many different fissures coming from where [[AA Player links/The Stygian Sepulchre\|The Stygian Sepulchre]] appeared is a collage in which [[AA Player links/The Archanist Guild\|The Archanist Guild]] operates from teaching others of magic and other basic skills. Whilst [[AA Player links/The Hanging Collage\|The Hanging Collage]] houses more general teaching skills it is renown for its study of the arcane and sepulchre. The reason for this place being suspended above a fissure is unknown but it is suspected that the whispers one hears when looking deep into the fissures inspires their minds into creating strange technologies.

# Rumours 

### Secret passages
It is said within the city there are multiple passages that have been forgotten about leading to old architecture and treasure within the city. Who knows what these so called passages hold or even where they are perhaps there are many. 
Furthermore it is also proposed that perhaps there is a way to traverse the internal city walls separating the districts.

### Carmine Guild Disappearances?
The sheer number of individuals going missing within the city on a daily basis is more than you could easily comprehend meaning that locating any one individual is near impossible. However, a while back it is said that there was some causal link created between a string of disappearances and [[AA Player links/The Carmine Guild\|The Carmine Guild]] but who knows what this connection. Any information regarding such issue has since been redacted or removed from public records but with a bit of digging who knows what you might find. Where have these people gone and what are they needed for?

### Old Artefacts
Rumours have been circulating around for a very long time now regarding the event that caused [[AA Player links/The Quarantine District\|The Quarantine District]] to be as it is today. Whatever has been said regarding this is still unanswered but what is known is anybody that enters that place comes back different. However all those who enter generally come back with information that challenges what is regarded as common knowledge as of current. Technology and even the simplest of things can challenge what we know today. Some say Old artefacts even challenge our understanding of [[Npcs/Estelle\|Estelle]] and even bring links to something called [[AA Player links/The Sacrament\|The Sacrament]]. Is any of this true who knows but the only way to find out is to investigate.
