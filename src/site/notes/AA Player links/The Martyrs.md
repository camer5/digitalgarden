## General
The Martyrs guild is the most influential power within [[AA Player links/The Stygian City\|The Stygian City]] even acting above the martial law. This organisation functions as a monster hunters guild to hunt [[AA Player links/The forces of the night\|The forces of the night]] and persuade, divert and lead operations against [[AA Player links/Star Spawn\|Star Spawn]]. Ever since [[AA Player links/The Stygian Sepulchre\|The Stygian Sepulchre]] materialized the Martyrs guild has been present seeming coming from unknown origins. Although mysterious this guild has provided and produced a safe zone through continuous and operations into the wilderness to repel threats.

Not much is known about the upper inner workings of this organisation due to the serious amount of obfuscation and secrets within the guild. Their guild leader, known only as [[AA Player links/The Herald\|The Herald]] is responsible for all actions within the guild and general actions. However within the guild not a soul other than a very select few have ever seen [[AA Player links/The Herald\|The Herald]]' face and the only one that is known is known as [[AA Player links/The Emissary\|The Emissary]]. Within [[AA Player links/The Magistrates\|The Magistrates]], [[AA Player links/The Emissary\|The Emissary]] acts as a face for the organisation funnelling all information to and from [[AA Player links/The Herald\|The Herald]] meaning not even [[AA Player links/The Magistrates\|The Magistrates]] know who this [[AA Player links/The Herald\|The Herald]] is. These very secrets give power over the rest of [[AA Player links/The Magistrates\|The Magistrates]] however cause tensions often causing resentment towards the guild. 

The guild operates through a form of donations and taxes put upon the people within the city as a form of protection. Whenever a raid is conducted or an area cleared for the city donation collectors go around the city and for the average citizen a base rate of tax is applied directly to the wages acting as a form of income for the guild and its members. However an individual with enough money can apply for a higher rate to gain priority protection or even to have personal guards specifically stationed by the guild. 

Due to their influence over all politics and other areas of the city they have been effectively appointed as a special task force throughout the city acting as the highest skilled individuals within the city (in regards to combat or deductive capabilities). Much to their dismay the [[AA Player links/City Enforcers\|City Enforcers]] must surrender command over any situation if it is deemed to be of sufficient threat to the city. Over the years this has formed a rivalry between the two guilds and as such the [[AA Player links/City Enforcers\|City Enforcers]] have given [[AA Player links/The Martyrs\|The Martyrs]] the nickname "leechers"

### [[AA Player links/ArchBishops\|ArchBishops]]
Underneath [[AA Player links/The Emissary\|The Emissary]] is the elite squad of soldiers used for extremely difficult missions or raids into the wastes. This squad of soldiers is one of the most pampered groups of individuals outside of the inner circle of [[AA Player links/The Magistrates\|Magistrates]] and upper nobles. They are known to be the strongest combatants across the plane and are rewarded as such with lavish feasts and magic items bestowed upon them. Within the [[AA Player links/ArchBishops\|ArchBishops]] there are 7 members all of which are known to the public with holidays and occasions denoted to them gaining them lots of fame and favor. 
### Apostles
Within [[AA Player links/The Martyrs\|The Martyrs]] guild there is 2 tiers of soldier (outside that of the [[AA Player links/ArchBishops\|ArchBishops]]) that function off of a points [[AA Player links/Monastic grading\|Monastic grading]] system demonstrating how powerful and dedicated an individual is to the cause. Each one of these grades dictates commodities that an individual can have access to and the pay that individual receives per job completion. Furthermore higher graded soldiers will have access to special training and job offers when visiting an [[AA Player links/Offering centre\|Offering centre]] within [[AA Player links/The Stygian City\|The Stygian City]].

### Acolytes

Traveling between grades within [[AA Player links/Monastic grading\|Monastic grading]] and also from an Acolyte to an Apostle requires a test where you will be asked to answer a question then told to defeat a foe either monster or human scaled relative to your abilities. After completing this task you will gain a rank and all the benefits that come with said rank. On the ground floor of the Acolyte tier you will only have access to missions at least until you have earned enough of a name for yourself to progress to the next tier. However this lower rank is generally quite hard to escape and comes with no added commodities.
### Monks
Monks within [[AA Player links/The Martyrs\|The Martyrs]] guild act as a form of involvement that doesn't require combat. These individuals have a merit based system granting them higher and higher rank based upon performance.
