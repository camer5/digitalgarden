# The Atrial Network

Throughout the city there is a network of interconnected pipes and cables that route to all corners of the city. Steampunk style industrial pipes carry what is presumed to be steam around the city. After traversing from the [[AA Player links/The Carmine Guild\|The Carmine Guild]] headquaters and around the city these pipes meet their end at [[AA Player links/Energy Substations\|Energy Substations]]. These substations then route psychic energy to their intended place through thick leathery clad cables. 

The reason this system is in place is to deliver magical energy simmilar to the form of spell slots to impliments and lighting within the city. Often this energy is used for large scale machinery but comes at a cost to the individual much like water from [[AA Player links/The Reservoir Guild\|The Reservoir Guild]].

One of the strange things of the Atrial network is that for some reason ther is no public knowledge or understanding of what the Atrial network actually is. Whenever some form of domestic terrorism, vadalism or even leak is found by the public [[AA Player links/The Carmine Guild\| Carmine Guild]] cleanup crews are already always there and body bags are always seen on site. Because of this mystery there is a lot of wonder and rumours that have formed surrounding what actually is within the pipes.
