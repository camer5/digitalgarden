## Low Light foods

Upon [[AA Player links/Palladius\|Palladius]] the lack of sunlight has forced the source of food to change from regular grains and meats to generally low light to no light crops. This shift has caused a massive drop in quality of food in general but at the cost of being able to still grow crops. Most food bearing crops are mushroom or greenery based giving enough nutrition to survive however at the cost of taste or the cost of texture. However people who are talented enough can manipulate these food sources into better actually tasty meals with lots of time and skill whilst still using the same low quality crops.

## Mushrooms
