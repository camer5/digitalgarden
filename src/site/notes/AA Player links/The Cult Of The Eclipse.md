<!-- ![cult of the eclipse symbol.png|center|300](/img/user/Images/cult%20of%20the%20eclipse%20symbol.png)-->
As of current nothing major is known of the cult of the eclipse however they are known to worship the dead god [[Npcs/Estelle\|Estelle]]. They are occasionally spotted within the city in multiple different places in obscuring garb suspected to be kidnapping people but so far no evidence of this has been found.

<!-- The cult of the eclipse is trying to resurrect the corpse of Estelle. within the cults headquarters there is an anomaly which is a fragment of  gold and black Stellite that retained a small portion of Estelle's consciousness but has since long since gone mad because of the effects of the seed of evil. This shard upon finding it was fed to a creature in hopes to push the consciousness into the person it was fed too but the creature that consumed the shard was not strong enough to contain its power. Since the creature was not strong enough the creatures body collapsed into itself and formed an anomaly like cocoon. Suspended within the temple that the cult uses is the remnants of this body constantly mutating and shifting only vaguely maintaining the shape of a humanoid. this anomaly is suspended by sinew like material between large stone columns as its form flickers in and out of reality. However the cult believes they need to feed the anomaly Stellite and biomass to maintain it and grow its strength. in the mean time the cult is looking for the perfect host to inhabit the anomaly as they believe that it will resurrect the god and bring prosperity to the world again. The reason they want Ellis' character is that they believe because they are an Aasimar and a child of a Valkyrie that they will be strong enough to house the soul and consciousness or what they think is Estelle
