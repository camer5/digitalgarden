# Energy Substations

Dotted around the city are large structures of iron and steel covered in pipes and cables. High walls and defensive wire protect whatever is within these small compounds from the public eye. However from the outside you can see strange rectangular cells/modules arranged across the outside surface of this strange structure of iron. Upon these modules are strange runes glowing with a slight red energy that often spark and burst with lightning to nearby metallic surfaces. 

Regularly large wagons of more of these modules will be brought onto the site of these substations being pulled by exacated basalisk covered in plating. Within these wagons are seemingly replacement modules to keep the plant running however the reason they need changing is unknown to the public.

One of the few things that is known about these structures is that any that approach the substations experience strange headaches and unless accustomed to the conditions can experience nose bleeds. What this energy is and how it is created is unkown but it is unlikely to be innocent in nature.
