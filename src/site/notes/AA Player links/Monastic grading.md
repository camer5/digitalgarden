# The Monastic Grading System

Within the monastic grading system there are multiple tiers of power that all come with their own benefits. To traverse each rank and progress up the chain of command and therefore increase the salary that you earn along with the added benefits you generally must complete a certain number of tasks and then take a test for you to be able to progress up the ranks.
