# The Sun

![Estelle's corpse.png](/img/user/Images/Estelle's%20corpse.png)

***

Across [[AA Player links/Palladius\|Palladius]] there is no true sunlight... not any more. Ever since [[AA Player links/The Day Of Oblivion\|The Day Of Oblivion]] where [[Npcs/Estelle\|Estelle]] was destroyed, no sunlight has shone across this plane. A constant shroud of twilight echoes across the plane as the only thing that remains is the corpse of [[Npcs/Estelle\|Estelle]].

Upon the death of [[Npcs/Estelle\|Estelle]] any form of daylight cycle has ceased to be rendering some of this plane in a permanent darkness and the rest in a chilling light. This little remaining light that mortality clings to is the little light that is shed from the corpse of [[Npcs/Estelle\|Estelle]]. It is proposed that due to being a divine entity her corpse itself naturally produces a small amount of light. This light however is insufficient for most if not all regular surface plants to survive upon permanently altering the [[AA Player links/Landscape\|Landscape]] of [[AA Player links/Palladius\|Palladius]]. This in turn has meant a drastic change to the plant life and [[AA Player links/Daily life\|Daily life]] of the average inhabitancy of this plane. 

It is unknown if the star will reignite or whether anything will come to replace it but for now the last bits or mortality bask in whatever remains of its light.

***

Without the light of [[Npcs/Estelle\|Estelle]], [[AA Player links/The forces of the night\|The forces of the night]] have been able to take hold destroying cities and ravaging the [[AA Player links/Landscape\|Landscape]]. [[AA Player links/Palladius\|Palladius]] is a shell of its former self and as such has had to make some changes to ensure that people can survive its new harsh state.

People have resorted to [[AA Player links/Low light foods\|Low light foods]] and have reduced the number of livestock to next to nothing. As such food is much harder to come by causing a massive number of droughts and famines.

Furthermore, due to these changes the building materials of [[AA Player links/Palladius\|Palladius]] and [[AA Player links/The Stygian City\|The Stygian City]] have had to change to match the availability of these resources.

# Rumours

#### [[AA Player links/The Cult Of The Eclipse\|The Cult Of The Eclipse]]

This cult is said to be trying to resurrect the corpse of [[Npcs/Estelle\|Estelle]] to try and reignite the star in the sky and bring prosperity to this plane once more. However nothing is confirmed and it is just as likely that this cult is in fact trying to consume or destroy what little remains of her cadaver.

Whatever their motivations are, they seem to be heavily linked to the star in some regards and seem to be the reason for some disappearances.
