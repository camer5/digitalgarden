# The landscape of Palladius
***

[[AA Player links/Palladius\|Palladius]] was once a landscape of untold riches and bounty flourishing with nature and fauna dotted with towering cities and settlements of untold size. There wasn't a place upon [[AA Player links/Palladius\|Palladius]] that you couldn't thrive and do whatever you wished. The marvel that was this plane was often shown with the strange magical devices, spells, technology and more but that all changed upon [[AA Player links/The Day Of Oblivion\|The Day Of Oblivion]].

Now however [[AA Player links/Palladius\|Palladius]] is a barren wasteland of large stony deserts separated by [[AA Player links/Gravewoods\|Gravewoods]] and towering ruins. Not only did the god [[Npcs/Estelle\|Estelle]] die upon that fateful day but the plane itself. 

The terrain fractured in a temper tantrum as fissures opened and with them came [[AA Player links/The forces of the night\|The forces of the night]]. Pouring out of these cracks were creatures unseen before this and only rumoured in history books of a time long since past. 

Furthermore, to add to this rending of the plane came [[AA Player links/Stellite\|Stellite]] and [[AA Player links/The Umbra\|The Umbra]] two sides of the same coin yet both just as deadly. These forces fell from the sky now infecting the landscape around them twisting it and distorting the already broken copse of this plane. 

Because of these events the terrain within this plane is in a constant state of flux ever so slightly shifting as the whims of the universe warp the ground beneath you. However even in this state of change there remains a rationality to the plane as if it claws and fights back trying to attain the beauty it once had. 

To adventure into this plane is to explore and to find both wonders and horrors of which the mind cannot comprehend but to do so one must survive the dangers that await you.

## The black desert

Due to the nature of this plane and its [[AA Player links/Sun\|Sun]] half of this plane is surrounded in constant darkness. This is because of the lack of a daylight cycle meaning that the [[AA Player links/Sun\|Sun]] no longer moves across the sky to bless even the remnants of its power upon the ground. This creates a zone perfect for [[AA Player links/The forces of the night\|The forces of the night]] to flourish. This side of the plane is called [[AA Player links/The Black desert\|The Black desert]] and it is a side of the plane that no mortal should ever travel too as it is certain to cut their life short.

## The Organic City

A decade ago the city of [[AA Player links/Ceres\|Ceres]] fell due to the outbreak of an immense level [[AA Player links/Star Spawn\|Star Spawn]] ravaging not only the city but the surrounding land. For miles around this city a large exclusion zone has been formed. This exclusion zone has been created as although much weaker this [[AA Player links/Star Spawn\|Star Spawn]] can attack and watch all those who pass through its influence.

## Crypts

Upon the day [[Npcs/Estelle\|Estelle]] fell [[AA Player links/Stellite\|Stellite]] and its [[AA Player links/The Umbra\|counterpart]] created zones now dubbed as [[AA Player links/Crypts\|Crypts]]. These [[AA Player links/Crypts\|Crypts]] ward away life with their mutagenic powers creating barren zones where nothing now lives and is excruciatingly quiet. 

These zones have no rhyme or reason for their positioning and are just where these forces fell. However [[AA Player links/The Umbra\|Umbra]] patches have a tendency to wander.

# Rumours

#### Old cities

It is said that old cities and towns within these [[AA Player links/Crypts\| Crypt]] zones are filled with treasures untold and sights you are unlikely to find anywhere else on this plane. But these treasures come with a risk unlike any other as [[AA Player links/The forces of the night\|The forces of the night]] and [[AA Player links/Star Spawn\|Star Spawn]] are common within these zones. Accompanied by the mutagenic influence of [[AA Player links/Stellite\|Stellite]] and its counterpart make these places something not to be trifled with

#### A Strange Presence

People upon traveling between [[AA Player links/Cities of Palladius\|cities]] that strayed to far from the beaten path have reported a strange presence coming from deep below the surface of the plane. This energy slips between the cracks of the plane and seeps out of the ravines and crevasses of the landscape. However none of these folk have been brave enough or strong enough to venture further.
