# The Seed of Evil
***

The Seed of Evil is a term used to describe the strange energy that was implanted into [[Npcs/Estelle\|Estelle]] within their fight all those years ago. Not much is known of this energy but what is known it is the exact thing that corrupted and destroyed [[Npcs/Estelle\|Estelle]]'s form indefinitely.

## Recounts

There have been multiple recounts of what people saw on [[AA Player links/The Day Of Oblivion\|The Day Of Oblivion]] and the events that lead up to this point but their accuracy is unknown.

A quote found from a half burned diary of a sundrop farmer found deep within a buried old building:
> "I saw [[Npcs/Estelle\|Estelle]] come back! 
> I were cleanin out t' waste bins ready to fertilize me sundrops when i felt a fammiliar warmth"
> "I turned to the sky and prayed when suddenly I could see her in all her glory"
> "But somethn were wrong 
> She were tired, and i couldn feel er gaze... well sorta "
> "I could feel somthin lookin at me but it wernt er"
> "It were like there were somthin lookin at me from t' woods but when i turn to look i saw nuthin"

This is believed to be one of the only recounts of the difference in atmosphere after [[Npcs/Estelle\|Estelle]] returned.

Another scrap of paper, presumed to be from some other book was found amongst the wreckage of a religious building. On this paper it details of what was perceived to be the ramblings of a mad man at the time.
>"SHES BACK!!
>But something isn't right the colour of her form is wrong, its bleak and drab! She is sick but nobody will listen to me. We have to save her... i dont know how but we have to!"
>*dried blood covers half of the page and the handwriting after significantly drops in quality*
>"They call me mad but I know it. She is sick and you will all suffer the consequences. Whoever finds this im almost certainly dead this wound in my head is too deep and I can't think straight, But heed my words something is about to happen... something big and I fear it is the end for all of us"

It is believed that this town crier unknowingly had access to some innate magic of some kind and that is why he could see the difference in colour of [[Npcs/Estelle\|Estelle]]'s magic. [[AA Player links/The Archanist Guild\|The Archanist Guild]] believes that this points to some sort of potential early warning system for [[AA Player links/Stellite\|Stellite]] but this theory has yet to be tested due to the many restrictions surrounding research into these topics.

The final excerpt found is believed to be the diary of a child describing what they felt in the days after [[Npcs/Estelle\|Estelle]]'s return.
>*The diary has many pages before this but none are relevant to the topic*
>"the sun seemz cold   mommy sayz that the god is bak but it stil cold outside" 
>*The writing trails off to irrelivancy for a period of time*
>"mommy wont lisen she thinks that everythin is ok but [[Npcs/Estelle\|estel]] is sick she told me not to wory but my tummy feels wrong"
>"last nite i had a nitemare   i was in the feeld with mr lizrd and just playin with toyz but when i looked up i coudnt sea the houze. (*the full stop is a sad face*) i looked a round and all i could sea waz the plants. so i started walkin and it kept goin  but then i turned around and the feeld waz gon. there waz just a houze in the middle of a grass bit i started to heer a bumpin over and over in my ears and my chest felt weerd like i waz beein squished. i walked to the houze but the grass waz wet but when i got there it was cold and the grass waz all white and cold. i think my mommy said it waz calld frost    i tried to look in the windowz but i was too small. so i went to the door and opened it.  it waz hevy but when i opend it there waz nothin there just a black like it was dark with no lantrn but even mor. i waz goin to turn around but i got pushd and i started fallin but i saw what looked like a man in all black and i screemd and screemd and screemd but it was qwiet. when i woke up my mommy and daddy were there cryin and my back hurt. mommy said i fell out of my bed and thats what hapend but i lookd in the water at my back and i could see a mark that lookd like a hand"

As of current it seems like during the events of the [[AA Player links/The Day Of Oblivion\|The Day Of Oblivion]] and after many people including this little girl experienced a connection with the Seed of Evil within [[Npcs/Estelle\|Estelle]] and potentially to the entity that infected [[Npcs/Estelle\|Estelle]] with it. Sights like this have been spotted all over in recent times but nothing can be done of them only to be prepared and to keep aware of any time this may happen.
