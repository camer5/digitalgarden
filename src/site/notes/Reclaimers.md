# Reclaimers

Reclaimers are a specialized team created by [[AA Player links/The Reservoir Guild\|The Reservoir Guild]] to head to sites where any form of water leak has occured and to reclaim said water. Generally they use some form of magic to transfer all water into containers often leaving property damaged to ensure that all water has been reclaimed properly. Afterwards a volume of water is calculated and an offer to buy the water outright is made or otherwise a fine is placed upon the individual that caused the leak. This often will result in some form of payment plan with lowered premiums to account for the material lost. However if the water is paid for outright and at the time of the leak then all interest and other such issues are voided and regular use of the service can continue.
